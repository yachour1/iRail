This is a placeholder for the railway-header.jpg image.

In a real implementation, this would be a high-quality image suitable for page headers showing railway infrastructure, ideally with a technical or professional feel.

The image should be:
- Widescreen format (1920x500px approximately)
- Showing railway tracks or signaling systems
- Professional quality
- Suitable for overlaying text /Users/yasslagazelle/Desktop/PhD/iRail/img/railway-header.jpg.placeholder
