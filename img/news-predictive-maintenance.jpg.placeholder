This is a placeholder for the news-predictive-maintenance.jpg image.

In a real implementation, this would be a high-quality image illustrating predictive maintenance in railway systems, possibly showing:
- Technicians using tablet or device to analyze rail conditions
- Sensors installed on railway tracks
- Data visualization of wear patterns
- Maintenance planning interface or dashboard

The image should be:
- High resolution (approximately 800x500px for article thumbnails)
- Showing both technical and human elements
- Professional quality
- Clearly conveying the concept of predictive maintenance
