This is a placeholder for the rail-vision-detection.jpg image.

In a real implementation, this would be a high-quality image showing the Rail Vision detection system in action, possibly showing:
- A railway track with a train
- Visual overlays showing AI detection capabilities
- Obstacle detection visualization
- The actual Rail Vision hardware/cameras

The image should be:
- High resolution (at least 1200x800px)
- Good lighting conditions
- Professional quality
- Demonstration of the technology in action
