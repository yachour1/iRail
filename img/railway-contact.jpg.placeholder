This is a placeholder for the railway-contact.jpg image.

In a real implementation, this would be a high-quality image suitable for the contact page header, potentially showing a control center or team working on railway monitoring systems.

The image should be:
- Widescreen format (1920x500px approximately)
- Potentially showing people working with technology or in a control room
- Professional and welcoming feel
- Suitable for overlaying text
